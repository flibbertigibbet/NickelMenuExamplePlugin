# Example Qt plugin for Kobo eReaders

This example plugin template uses the `NickelMenu` plugin interface to display a modal with screen size information. Running the plugin generator will produce a new plugin in `src` with the code from this plugin, renamed.

The code here is a lightly modified version of the example plugin in [this commit](https://github.com/pgaskin/NickelMenu/commit/02381b1f79e95c9eff14ec0666a2e5758dda0578) as proposed in the [plugin support issue](https://github.com/pgaskin/NickelMenu/issues/113).
